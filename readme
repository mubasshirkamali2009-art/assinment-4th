               Event Bubbling is when an event starts on the target element and then propagates upward to its parent elements, all the way to document


               4rth ans

               Event Delegation is when a parent element handles events for its child elements using event bubbling, instead of attaching listeners to every child

               yes its  useful

               5no ans

             preventDefault() prevents the browser's default behavior.

stopPropagation() prevents the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
